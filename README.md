## Hosting your static website generated by HUGO on a different source than your github page

We have a scenario where you are already using the default page `http(s)://<username>.github.io` so
you need to change your publishing source. </br>

### The next path could be a very easy solution, our starting point:

1. You have Hugo generator installed. (ref: [how install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing))
2. You have created and configure github repository where you want save your blog info. (ref: [creating and configuring Hugo static website](https://github.com/ldipotetjob/nomorethanonehundredandsixtysix/blob/master/README.md#creating-and-configuring-github-repo-to-store-the-site-previously-created))

### Now let's check if everything went well. Deploy in local

```shell
hugo server -D 
####
# ........
# Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
####
```

### It's time to build your website 

In your root directory:

```shell
hugo 
####
# ........
# build all html pages, so the next step must be populate the document which
# have been created peeviouly
####
```


### How our Hugo static website can be deployed on github page 
 1. The hugo static site will need a binding to a github url publishing source:</br>
    In the [config.toml](https://github.com/ldipotetjob/mojitoverde/blob/main/config.toml) file the key baseURL must have the github url   
    page </br>baseURL = `http(s)://<username>.github.io/$githubblogrepositoryname`
 2. The hugo static site will need to know the destination to generate the static site, this is a binding to github url      
    publishing source:</br>publishdir = "docs". **This folder name must be the same that you configure on setting your githubblogrepository pages source**<br> **ref how [configure publishing resources](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)** 
 3. Check that you are on $githubblogrepositoryname and then launch: hugo -D 
 4. Commit and upload the changes to remote and have fun üëç

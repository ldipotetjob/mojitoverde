![aboutme_img](/mojitoverde/images/aboutme.png#floatleft)
I am first a software engineer and then a cloud engineer. I'm fascinated by cutting-edge technologies, practicing sports, listening to music and mostly enjoying life with my two children and my wife. In my spare time I help people in the areas of technology or I write some articles on my blog. I am always studying and learning new technologies, not only in the fields of programming or the cloud. Some times Blockchain or Bioinformatics also catch my attention.

In this post we talk about  http api in play framework,  addressing some basic standards to  build RESTful API. Play Framework can be used widely in other scenarios which involve MVC for example. Honestly there are other frameworks more taylored for RESTful APIs. In my opinion trying to implement HATEOAS in Play Framework  is a nightmare so  this is a point that we won't approach.
I am assuming that you know the main concept of http protocol, its use and implementation as the core of concept when we talk properly about Restful Apis.

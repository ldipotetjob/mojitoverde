Trying to explain Kubernetes(k8s), I bring here a guide about how to make a very fruitful study of it. These thoughts are from a software developer perspective and well explained in Kubernetes(k8s) documentation.

An advice before beginning the study of k8s: 
* You should study in-depth about any **application container engine**, I suggest [docker](https://docs.docker.com/) but there are many others like [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/), [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) or any other that follows [OCI](https://www.opencontainers.org/)  specifications.

You will find here interesting resources that will help in  your journey : 
* [The documentation site](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#containers-and-virtual-machines) can guide you with several examples and practical tasks.  
* [Docker free lab](https://training.play-with-docker.com/) is very useful too, easy and intuitive and mainly it encompasses the whole learning process in Docker. 

The previous resources will help you to understand the most important aspects related to container engine.

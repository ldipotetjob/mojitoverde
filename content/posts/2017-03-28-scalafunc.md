In this post I will talk about the role of functions in scala, how create them and its implication on the scala language. We are going to run many of them from Scala REPL (“**Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop**”). 

We want to make clear we are working with scala 2.x
You can find below some useful commad and if you want to go deeper try the [Scala REPL page](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html):  

* use `:quit` to exit from the scala REPL.
* use `tab` for completion.
* use `:help` for a list of commands.
* use `:paste` to enter a class and object as companions.
